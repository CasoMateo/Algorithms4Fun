**Algorithm Idea**

Find the two ways an alternating binary 
string can be formed based on the input's 
size. Then, iterate over both of these and 
return the minimum number of discrepancies 
there are with the original string. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 44 ms, faster than 87.39% of Python3 online submissions for Minimum Changes To Make Alternating Binary String.
Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 87.16% of Python3 online submissions for Minimum Changes To Make Alternating Binary String.
