**Algorithm Idea**

For every item that is equal to target, 
minimize the result by computing 
abs(i - start). 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 56 ms, faster than 68.62% of Python3 online submissions for Minimum Distance to the Target Element.
Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 91.28% of Python3 online submissions for Minimum Distance to the Target Element.
