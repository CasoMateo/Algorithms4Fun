**Algorithm Idea**

If the previous element is not strictly 
smaller than the current one, make the necessary 
adjustments for such number. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 132 ms, faster than 64.97% of Python3 online submissions for Minimum Operations to Make the Array Increasing.
Memory Usage: 14.8 MB, less than 94.05% of Python3 online submissions for Minimum Operations to Make the Array Increasing.
