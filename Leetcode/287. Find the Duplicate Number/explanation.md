**Algorithm Idea**

As we iterate over the array, add the elements to a set. 
For every item, check if it has already been seen, and if 
it has, return the duplicate number.

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 584 ms, faster than 27.64% of Python3 online submissions for Find the Duplicate Number.
Memory Usage: 30.5 MB, less than 6.55% of Python3 online submissions for Find the Duplicate Number.
