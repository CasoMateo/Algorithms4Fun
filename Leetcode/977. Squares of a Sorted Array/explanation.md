**Algorithm Idea**

Replace each element in the 
array with its respective square. 
Return the sorted version of such elements. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(Nlog(N)).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 228 ms, faster than 57.44% of Python3 online submissions for Squares of a Sorted Array.
Memory Usage: 15.8 MB, less than 93.42% of Python3 online submissions for Squares of a Sorted Array.
