**Algorithm Idea**

For each word, check if the first n characters, 
where n is the length of the prefix, match the given 
purefix. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(NÂ²).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 61 ms, faster than 55.56% of Python3 online submissions for Counting Words With a Given Prefix.
Memory Usage: 14 MB, less than 55.56% of Python3 online submissions for Counting Words With a Given Prefix.
