**Algorithm Idea**

While the length of the number is greater 
than one, add up all of its digits. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 34 ms, faster than 70.89% of Python3 online submissions for Add Digits.
Memory Usage: 13.9 MB, less than 91.07% of Python3 online submissions for Add Digits.
