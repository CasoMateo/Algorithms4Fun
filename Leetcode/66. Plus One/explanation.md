**Algorithm Idea**

Get all of the digits in integer form, 
add one digit to the whole number, and 
return each resulting digit separately. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 28 ms, faster than 88.80% of Python3 online submissions for Plus One.
Memory Usage: 14.1 MB, less than 92.23% of Python3 online submissions for Plus One.
