**Algorithm Idea**

For every number ranging 
from left to right, check if any 
interval covers such value by 
using the problem constraints. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(NÂ²).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 36 ms, faster than 93.04% of Python3 online submissions for Check if All the Integers in a Range Are Covered.
Memory Usage: 14.1 MB, less than 94.97% of Python3 online submissions for Check if All the Integers in a Range Are Covered.
