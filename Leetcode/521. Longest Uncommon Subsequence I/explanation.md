**Algorithm Idea**

If both arrays are equal, there is no 
uncommon subsequence. Otherwise, the 
maximum uncommon subsequence will be the length of 
the longest array. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(min(len(a), len(b)).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 24 ms, faster than 95.71% of Python3 online submissions for Longest Uncommon Subsequence I.
Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 41.66% of Python3 online submissions for Longest Uncommon Subsequence I.
