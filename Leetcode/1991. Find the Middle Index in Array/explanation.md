**Algorithm Idea**

Get the sum of all elements after and before 
the current index by using the total one and substracting seen 
elements. If they are equal, return 
the current index. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 36 ms, faster than 100.00% of Python3 online submissions for Find the Middle Index in Array.
Memory Usage: 14 MB, less than 100.00% of Python3 online submissions for Find the Middle Index in Array.
