**Algorithm Idea**

Swap each item of the list with its 
counterpart.

**Complexities**

Time: O(N) - half of the array is traversed.
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 192 ms, faster than 79.83% of Python3 online submissions for Reverse String.
Memory Usage: 18.5 MB, less than 90.68% of Python3 online submissions for Reverse String.
