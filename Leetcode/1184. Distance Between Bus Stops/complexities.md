**Algorithm Idea**

The first option is to go from 
the start destination to the final 
destination (for loop from start to 
destination), and the other one is to go from 
the final destination to the first destination 
(for loop from destination to the length of the array 
plus the start). 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 48 ms, faster than 67.58% of Python3 online submissions for Distance Between Bus Stops.
Memory Usage: 15.2 MB, less than 34.66% of Python3 online submissions for Distance Between Bus Stops.
