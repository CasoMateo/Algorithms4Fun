**Algorithm Idea**

For each iteration, update the coordinate we are 
currently in. Check if such coordinate has already 
been visited before. Otherwise, add the current coordinate 
to a set. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 34 ms, faster than 29.54% of Python3 online submissions for Path Crossing.
Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 83.23% of Python3 online submissions for Path Crossing.
