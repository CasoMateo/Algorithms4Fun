**Algorithm Idea**

For every element target number 
in the list, check if it has already been seen. 
If not, we have found the first index. Iterate over the list backwards, 
and thus find the last occurrence of the target value. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 64 ms, faster than 74.38% of Python online submissions for Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array.
Memory Usage: 15.2 MB, less than 5.82% of Python online submissions for Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array.
