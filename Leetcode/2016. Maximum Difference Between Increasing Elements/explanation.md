**Algorithm Idea**

Look for the maximum element to the right of 
the current index. If it is greater, update 
the "longest" variable respectively. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(NÂ²).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 116 ms, faster than 23.08% of Python3 online submissions for Maximum Difference Between Increasing Elements.
Memory Usage: 14.4 MB, less than 84.62% of Python3 online submissions for Maximum Difference Between Increasing Elements.
