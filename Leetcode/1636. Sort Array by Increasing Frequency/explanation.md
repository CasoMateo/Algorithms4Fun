**Algorithm Idea**

Get all of the arraỳ frequencies and group numbers that 
share them in decreasing order.

**Complexities**

Time: O(N²log(N)).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 48 ms, faster than 86.83% of Python3 online submissions for Sort Array by Increasing Frequency.
Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 56.80% of Python3 online submissions for Sort Array by Increasing Frequency.
