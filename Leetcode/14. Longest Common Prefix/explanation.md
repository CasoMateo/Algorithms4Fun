**Algorithm Idea**

Keep track of a current prefix, and find this string's intersection 
with each item in the array. Update the variable with the data's 
similarities, and compare this for the subsequent iteration.

**Complexities**

Time: O(NÂ²).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 36 ms, faster than 49.67% of Python3 online submissions.
Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 82.26% of Python3 online submissions.
