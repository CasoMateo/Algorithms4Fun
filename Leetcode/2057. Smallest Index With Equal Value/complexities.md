**Algorithm Idea**

Traverse each index in the array and check if 
its respective remainder when being divided by 10 
is nums[i].

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 80 ms, faster than 100.00% of Python3 online submissions for Smallest Index With Equal Value.
Memory Usage: 14 MB, less than 100.00% of Python3 online submissions for Smallest Index With Equal Value.
