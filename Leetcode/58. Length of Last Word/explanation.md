**Algorithm Idea**

Iterate through the list and if the current item is 
a space, start a new count. Otherwise, keep track of the length 
of the current count.

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 32 ms, faster than 47.83% of Python3 online submissions for Length of Last Word.
Memory Usage: 14.4 MB, less than 35.61% of Python3 online submissions for Length of Last Word.
