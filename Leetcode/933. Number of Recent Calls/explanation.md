**Algorithm Idea**

Every element that was once not needed will never be needed again. Update "requests" for each function call, and return its renewed length.

**Complexities**

Time: O(N). Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 276 ms, faster than 88.94% of Python3 online submissions for Number of Recent Calls. Memory Usage: 18.9 MB, less than 70.18% of Python3 online submissions for Number of Recent Calls.
