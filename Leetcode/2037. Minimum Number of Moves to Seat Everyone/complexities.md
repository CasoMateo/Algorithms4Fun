**Algorithm Idea**

Sort both lists, and iterate over them 
simultaneously. Find the difference between 
each pair of elements, which represents the current 
number of operations needed to match such items. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(Nlog(N)).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 60 ms, faster than 100.00% of Python3 online submissions for Minimum Number of Moves to Seat Everyone.
Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 60.00% of Python3 online submissions for Minimum Number of Moves to Seat Everyone.
