**Algorithm Idea**

Iterate over the array until 
the array becomes decreasing. 
If so, return the current index, or 
"peak" of the mountain. 
  
**Complexities**
 
Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).
    
**Results**
  
Runtime: 72 ms, faster than 80.44% of Python3 online submissions for Peak Index in a Mountain Array.
Memory Usage: 15.4 MB, less than 57.26% of Python3 online submissions for Peak Index in a Mountain Array.
