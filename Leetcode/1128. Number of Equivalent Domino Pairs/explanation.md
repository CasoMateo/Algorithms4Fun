**Algorithm Idea**

Find elements whose frequency is above 
1. For each frequency, find the number of  
combinations those respective elements can be put 
together, where order doesn't matter. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 240 ms, faster than 64.44% of Python3 online submissions for Number of Equivalent Domino Pairs.
Memory Usage: 23.6 MB, less than 86.32% of Python3 online submissions for Number of Equivalent Domino Pairs.
