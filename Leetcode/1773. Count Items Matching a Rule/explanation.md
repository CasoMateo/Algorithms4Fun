**Algorithm Idea**

Identify the type of value for each input, and 
use such index to compare the current items with 
the ruleValue. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 240 ms, faster than 79.89% of Python3 online submissions for Count Items Matching a Rule.
Memory Usage: 20.5 MB, less than 66.05% of Python3 online submissions for Count Items Matching a Rule.
