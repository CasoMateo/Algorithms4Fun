**Algorithm Idea**

Identify the type of value for each input, and 
use such index to compare the current items with 
the ruleValue. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 236 ms, faster than 89.35% of Python3 online submissions for Count Items Matching a Rule.
Memory Usage: 20.4 MB, less than 98.72% of Python3 online submissions for Count Items Matching a Rule.
