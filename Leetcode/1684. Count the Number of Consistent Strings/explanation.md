**Algorithm Idea**

Check if every letter in each word can be found 
in the string "allowed" using set comparison. 
See whether the characters of the current string 
are a subset of those of "allowed". 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 232 ms, faster than 72.77% of Python3 online submissions for Count the Number of Consistent Strings.
Memory Usage: 15.9 MB, less than 96.97% of Python3 online submissions for Count the Number of Consistent Strings.
