**Algorithm Idea**

Get all the different lifetimes in logs.
Then, get the most common year within those ranges.

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 44 ms, faster than 63.24% of Python3 online submissions for Maximum Population Year.
Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 41.91% of Python3 online submissions for Maximum Population Year.
