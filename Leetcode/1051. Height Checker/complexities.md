**Algorithm Idea**

Find the number of times where expected[i] != heights[i], 
where expected is the sorted version of heights.

**Complexities**

Time: O(Nlog(N)).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 36 ms, faster than 76.27% of Python3 online submissions for Height Checker.
Memory Usage: 14.1 MB, less than 91.00% of Python3 online submissions for Height Checker.
