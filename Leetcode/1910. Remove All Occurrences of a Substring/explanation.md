**Algorithm Idea**

While the string is not empty, remove one 
occurrence of the given substring every iteration. 

**Complexity**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 28 ms, faster than 93.81% of Python3 online submissions for Remove All Occurrences of a Substring.
Memory Usage: 14.1 MB, less than 90.03% of Python3 online submissions for Remove All Occurrences of a Substring.
