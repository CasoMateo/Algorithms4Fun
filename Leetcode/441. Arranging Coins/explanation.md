**Algorithm Idea**

Keep track of the current sum, and for each iteration, confirm the sum 
doesn't exceed the number. If it doesn't, increase "counter" by 1. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 1048 ms, faster than 31.05% of Python3 online submissions.
Memory Usage: 14 MB, less than 87.98% of Python3 online submissions.
