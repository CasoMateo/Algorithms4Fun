**Algorithm Idea**

For every element, check if there exists another element that 
when substracted with the current one forms k. If k is zero, 
simply check if the frequency of the current element is greater than one. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N). 
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 92 ms, faster than 61.13% of Python3 online submissions for K-diff Pairs in an Array.
Memory Usage: 16.1 MB, less than 31.62% of Python3 online submissions for K-diff Pairs in an Array.
