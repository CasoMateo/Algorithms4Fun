**Algorithm Idea**

Move all nums2 elements to nums1. 
Then, sort nums1 and return the modified 
array. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(Nlog(N)).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 28 ms, faster than 97.93% of Python3 online submissions for Merge Sorted Array.
Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 62.52% of Python3 online submissions for Merge Sorted Array.
