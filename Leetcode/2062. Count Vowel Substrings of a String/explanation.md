**Algorithm Idea**

Get every single substring and check its 
corresponding characters are limited to, but 
include, all vowels.

**Complexities**

Time: O(NÂ²).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 252 ms, faster than 78.95% of Python3 online submissions for Count Vowel Substrings of a String.
Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 94.74% of Python3 online submissions for Count Vowel Substrings of a String.
