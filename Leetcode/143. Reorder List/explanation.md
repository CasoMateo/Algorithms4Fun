**Algorithm Idea**

Get all of the numbers in the linked list, and 
follow the problem constraints to reorder the 
given elements according to this array.

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 84 ms, faster than 94.16% of Python3 online submissions for Reorder List.
Memory Usage: 23.3 MB, less than 77.99% of Python3 online submissions for Reorder List.
