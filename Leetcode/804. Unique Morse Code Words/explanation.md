**Algorithm Idea**

Map each letter to a position in the character 
to morse code combination list. For each word 
in words, create a current string with the 
current sequence of codes. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N*M) - where m is the length of current word.
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 32 ms, faster than 89.45% of Python3 online submissions for Unique Morse Code Words.
Memory Usage: 14.1 MB, less than 83.53% of Python3 online submissions for Unique Morse Code Words.
