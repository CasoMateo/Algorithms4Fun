**Algorithm Idea**

Sort the array, and find the minimum elements 
in each pair by using the current item every 
two iterations. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(Nlog(N)).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 281 ms, faster than 45.43% of Python3 online submissions for Array Partition I.
Memory Usage: 16.6 MB, less than 97.98% of Python3 online submissions for Array Partition I.
