**Algorithm Idea**

For every item in the list, find an element 
that is greater than the current one. The starting 
index is attributed to the index of the current 
number in nums2. Append -1 if such element is not 
found. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(NÂ²).
Space: O(N) - output array.

**Results**

Runtime: 68 ms, faster than 36.11% of Python3 online submissions for Next Greater Element I.
Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 90.24% of Python3 online submissions for Next Greater Element I.
