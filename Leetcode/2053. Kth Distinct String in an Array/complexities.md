**Algorithm Idea**

Traverse the array, and check whether 
such element has a frequency of 1. If it does, 
check if it is the element we are looking for by 
decreasing k each time it is not. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 72 ms, faster than 50.00% of Python3 online submissions for Kth Distinct String in an Array.
Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 100.00% of Python3 online submissions for Kth Distinct String in an Array.
