**Algorithm Idea**

Initialize an empty dictionary, and iterate over the array. For every element, 
check if it has already been seen, and adjust its count respectively. Then, 
iterate through the dictionary and find the element that appears more than 25% percent 
of the time in the array.

**Complexities**

Time: O(N)
Space: O(N)

**Results**

Runtime: 84 ms, faster than 86.95 of all Python3 online submissions.
Memory Usage: 15.7 MB, less than 29.15% of all Python3 online submissions.
