**Algorithm Idea**

If both arrays are equal, check if there is a 
a duplicate element in s. If so, these could just be 
swapped having no repercussions. Otherwise, look for differing 
elements. Check if the length of differing pairs equals 
two and whether both pairs are the same. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).
