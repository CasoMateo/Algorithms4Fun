**Algorithm Idea**

Find a common ground between each string (sorting),
and create a hash table to add similar elements. 
Traverse the dictionary and generate the output 
array.

**Complexities**

Time: O(N*M) - where m is the length of each individual 
item of the list. 

Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 88 ms, faster than 96.57% of Python3 online submissions for Group Anagrams.
Memory Usage: 17 MB, less than 94.80% of Python3 online submissions for Group Anagrams.
