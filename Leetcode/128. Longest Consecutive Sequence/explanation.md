**Algorithm Idea**

Remove all duplicates from the list and sort the 
remaining items. Use the sliding window technique 
to find the subarrays that satisfy the given 
conditions. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(Nlog(N)).

Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 200 ms, faster than 64.34% of Python3 online submissions for Longest Consecutive Sequence.
Memory Usage: 25.8 MB, less than 56.35% of Python3 online submissions for Longest Consecutive Sequence.
