**Algorithm Idea**

Follow the problem description and check if 
the current number has already been seen. 
If such condition is true, than the number 1 will 
never be reached because the same pattern will occur 
infinetely. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N*m) - where m is the length of the largest number found. 
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 24 ms, faster than 99.22% of Python3 online submissions for Happy Number.
Memory Usage: 14.4 MB, less than 15.64% of Python3 online submissions for Happy Number.
