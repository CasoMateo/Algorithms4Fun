**Algorithm Idea**

Find the state of the running sum that most 
differs from zero in a decreasing way. Find the 
difference between such amount and the number one. 
This is because the initial sum is 0, making it neutral.

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 32 ms, faster than 65.61% of Python3 online submissions for Minimum Value to Get Positive Step by Step Sum.
Memory Usage: 14.1 MB, less than 93.02% of Python3 online submissions for Minimum Value to Get Positive Step by Step Sum.
