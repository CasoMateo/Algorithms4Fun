**Algorithm Idea**

Because the maximum input length is 10000, if we 
exceed such quantity, we have found a repeating 
pattern.

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 60 ms, faster than 40.42% of Python3 online submissions for Linked List Cycle.
Memory Usage: 17.6 MB, less than 80.91% of Python3 online submissions for Linked List Cycle.
