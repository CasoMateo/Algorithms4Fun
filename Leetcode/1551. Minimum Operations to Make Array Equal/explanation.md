**Algorithm Idea**

Use the problem formula to compute 
the amount of operations needed to make any symmetrical 
pair of numbers equal using two pointers. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 132 ms, faster than 26.58% of Python3 online submissions for Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal.
Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 51.42% of Python3 online submissions for Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal.
