**Algorithm Idea**

Find the difference between two coordinates, and select the 
longest route to get to the current point. The substracts are 
performed for both x and y.

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 56 ms, faster than 78.75% of Python3 online submissions for Minimum Time Visiting All Points.
Memory Usage: 14.4 MB, less than 37.58% of Python3 online submissions for Minimum Time Visiting All Points.
