**Algorithm Idea**

Set a threshold (half of the maximum number) and compare each item 
in the list to this quantity. If no element is greater than the 
limit, then we return the number's index. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1). 

**Results**

Runtime: 32 ms, faster than 85.08% of Python3 online submissions.
Memory Usage: 13.9 MB, less than 99.93% of Python3 online submissions.
