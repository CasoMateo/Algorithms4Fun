**Algorithm Idea**

If the given measures don't match the array's 
length, return an empty array. Otherwise, look for m 
subarrays of length n and return each one of them 
as a list within a list. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 1016 ms, faster than 89.48% of Python3 online submissions for Convert 1D Array Into 2D Array.
Memory Usage: 22 MB, less than 49.56% of Python3 online submissions for Convert 1D Array Into 2D Array.
