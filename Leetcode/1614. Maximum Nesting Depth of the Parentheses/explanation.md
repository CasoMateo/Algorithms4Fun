**Algorithm Idea**

For every opening parenthesis seen, 
increase the depth by one. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1). 

**Results**

Runtime: 42 ms, faster than 46.10% of Python3 online submissions for Maximum Nesting Depth of the Parentheses.
Memory Usage: 13.8 MB, less than 91.53% of Python3 online submissions for Maximum Nesting Depth of the Parentheses.
