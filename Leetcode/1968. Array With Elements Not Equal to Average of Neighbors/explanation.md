**Algorithm Idea**

Sort the array and swap adjacent 
elements every`two items. This way,
the average of two external numbers 
will never equal the inner element. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(Nlog(N)).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 1424 ms, faster than 84.96% of Python3 online submissions for Array With Elements Not Equal to Average of Neighbors.
Memory Usage: 28.7 MB, less than 99.95% of Python3 online submissions for Array With Elements Not Equal to Average of Neighbors.
