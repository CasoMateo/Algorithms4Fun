**Algorithm Idea**

Get all the separate words, or characters, 
from the given string. Create a dictionary 
containing the occurrence of each case-insensitive 
element in the array and sort it in a decreasing fashion. 
Return the first word to not be included in the 
given list "banned". 

**Complexities**

Time: O(Nlog(N)).
Space: O(N)
