**Algorithm Idea**

Because the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, 
iterate over the list and return the first element 
to be greater than target. Return the first item of the 
list of such element is not found. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 104 ms, faster than 91.29% of Python3 online submissions for Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target.
Memory Usage: 14.6 MB, less than 76.87% of Python3 online submissions for Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target.
