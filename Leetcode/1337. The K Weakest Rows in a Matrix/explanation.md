**Algorithm Idea**

Get all of the soldier frequency and get the first k of them, sorted 
from lowest to highest.

**Complexities**

Time: O(Nlog(N)).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 116 ms, faster than 40.31% of Python3 online submissions for The K Weakest Rows in a Matrix.
Memory Usage: 14.5 MB, less than 77.75% of Python3 online submissions for The K Weakest Rows in a Matrix.
