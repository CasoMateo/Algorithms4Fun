**Algorithm Idea**

For each item in the list, check if it is the binary number 1. 
If the condition is true, then increase the temporary variable "current". 
Update the result to the variable that is greater (cur or longest). 
If the number is 0, then start a new count. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**
