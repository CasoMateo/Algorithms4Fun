**Algorithm Idea**

Find the frequency of each element in 
the array. Traverse the formed dictionary 
in a decreasing fashion until the current 
sum of frequencies adds up to at least 
half of the array's initial size.

**Complexities**

Time: O(Nlog(N)).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 572 ms, faster than 70.85% of Python3 online submissions for Reduce Array Size to The Half.
Memory Usage: 30.9 MB, less than 87.01% of Python3 online submissions for Reduce Array Size to The Half.
