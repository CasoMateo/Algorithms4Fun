**Algorithm Idea**

If the peak has not yet been seen, 
all numbers should be increasing. Once 
we get to the peak, all elements should be 
decreasing. The array is not a mountain array 
if it does not have a peak at all. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 208 ms, faster than 61.05% of Python3 online submissions for Valid Mountain Array.
Memory Usage: 15.5 MB, less than 87.90% of Python3 online submissions for Valid Mountain Array.
