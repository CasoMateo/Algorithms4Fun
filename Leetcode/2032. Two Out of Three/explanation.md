**Algorithm Idea**

Get all the different elements over the three 
arrays. For each one of them, check if it appears 
at least twice across all the arrays. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 76 ms, faster than 62.50% of Python3 online submissions for Two Out of Three.
Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 100.00% of Python3 online submissions for Two Out of Three.
