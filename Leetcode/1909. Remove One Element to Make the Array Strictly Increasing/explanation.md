**Algorithm Idea**

Inefficient solution: goes through every 
combination of elements. 

Check if the array can become strictly increasing 
if any number of the list is removed. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(NÂ²).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 1060 ms, faster than 5.45% of Python3 online submissions for Remove One Element to Make the Array Strictly Increasing.
Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 75.55% of Python3 online submissions for Remove One Element to Make the Array Strictly Increasing.
