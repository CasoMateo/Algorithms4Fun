**Algorithm Idea**

Use a set to store the digits found in the 
string. Remove the largest element from the 
set, and return the largest one remaining. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 28 ms, faster than 97.62% of Python3 online submissions for Second Largest Digit in a String.
Memory Usage: 14 MB, less than 94.00% of Python3 online submissions for Second Largest Digit in a String.
