**Algorithm Idea**

For every item, check of the element can be found in the other 
array. If so, remove it from the structure and add the number to 
"result". 

**Complexities**

Time: O(Nlog(N).
Space: O(N).


**Results**

Runtime: 52 ms, faster than 27.52% of Python3 online submissions for Intersection of Two Arrays II.
Memory Usage: 14.4 MB, less than 39.03% of Python3 online submissions for Intersection of Two Arrays II.
