**Algorithm Idea**

Return the first element found to be greater than the next one. 
This is because while this condition is not met, previous elements 
are less than the current one, so only one constraint needs to be checked. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 36 ms, faster than 98.51% of Python3 online submissions for Find Peak Element.
Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 90.78% of Python3 online submissions for Find Peak Element.
