**Algorithm Idea**

Use the binary search approach to find the
peak element. In addition, check both ends of the 
initial array as they may also be peaks. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(log(N)).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 40 ms, faster than 92.91% of Python3 online submissions for Find Peak Element.
Memory Usage: 14.4 MB, less than 72.93% of Python3 online submissions for Find Peak Element.
