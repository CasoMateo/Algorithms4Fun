**Algorithm Idea**

If the current element is not a space, that means we have found 
a segment. Once we see a space, check if we have already seen a segment. 
If so, the number of segments increases. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 24 ms, faster than 95.06% of Python3 online submissions for Number of Segments in a String.
Memory Usage: 13.9 MB, less than 98.29% of Python3 online submissions for Number of Segments in a String.
