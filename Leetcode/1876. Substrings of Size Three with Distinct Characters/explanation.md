**Algorithm Idea**

Evaluate every possible substring of
size three and check if 
the set version (due to the fact that 
they don't allow duplicates) of such sequence is 
equal to the original one. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 32 ms, faster than 73.86% of Python3 online submissions for Substrings of Size Three with Distinct Characters.
Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 73.53% of Python3 online submissions for Substrings of Size Three with Distinct Characters.
