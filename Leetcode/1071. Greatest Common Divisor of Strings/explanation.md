**Algorithm Idea**

Get all possible substrings that divide the 
smaller string, and return the first one 
to divide both of them traversing backwards.

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 36 ms, faster than 42.40% of Python3 online submissions for Greatest Common Divisor of Strings.
Memory Usage: 14.1 MB, less than 81.87% of Python3 online submissions for Greatest Common Divisor of Strings.
