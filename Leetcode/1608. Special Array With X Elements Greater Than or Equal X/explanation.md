**Algorithm Idea**

Sort the array and get the cur amount 
of elements that are needed to make a number special.
Check if the current element is greater than or equal 
to such number, and whether the previous number disrupts 
the system.

**Complexities**

Time: O(Nlog(N)).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 32 ms, faster than 92.35% of Python3 online submissions for Special Array With X Elements Greater Than or Equal X.
Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 46.46% of Python3 online submissions for Special Array With X Elements Greater Than or Equal X.
