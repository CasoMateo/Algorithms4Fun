**Algorithm Idea**

Sort the array, and update the minimum variable 
based on the difference between the maximum 
and minimum elements in the current subarray.

**Complexities**

Time: O(Nlog(N)).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 98 ms, faster than 84.52% of Python3 online submissions for Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores.
Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 84.64% of Python3 online submissions for Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores.
