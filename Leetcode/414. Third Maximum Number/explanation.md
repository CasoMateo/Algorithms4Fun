**Algorithm Idea**

If the total number of different characters does not exceed 
2, return the maximum number. Otherwise, return the third 
number in a sorted set, where no elements are repeated. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(Nlog(N)).
Space: O(N).


**Results**

Runtime: 48 ms, faster than 90.03% of Python3 online submissions for Third Maximum Number.
Memory Usage: 15.4 MB, less than 50.78% of Python3 online submissions for Third Maximum Number.
