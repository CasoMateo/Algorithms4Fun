**Algorithm Idea**

Get the index of elements equal to the 
target number after sorting the array.


**Complexities**

Time: O(Nlog(N)).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 40 ms, faster than 100.00% of Python3 online submissions for Find Target Indices After Sorting Array.
Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 100.00% of Python3 online submissions for Find Target Indices After Sorting Array.
