**Algorithm Idea**

For every odd number seen, increase the 
current count of odd numbers. Otherwise, 
start all over again. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 40 ms, faster than 94.01% of Python3 online submissions for Three Consecutive Odds.
Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 80.30% of Python3 online submissions for Three Consecutive Odds.
