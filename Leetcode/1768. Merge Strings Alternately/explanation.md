**Algorithm Idea**

Find the string with the minimum length, and 
add the ith element of word1 and word2 each iteration. At the end, account for any remaining 
items by checking whether one string's length is 
greater than the other. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 28 ms, faster than 83.44% of Python3 online submissions for Merge Strings Alternately.
Memory Usage: 14.1 MB, less than 93.59% of Python3 online submissions for Merge Strings Alternately.
