**Algorithm Idea**

Get the rank of each element in the array. 
As we traverse the list, check if the current 
element lies between the first and third places 
to categorize such item accordingly. Otherwise, 
just replace the value of the current index with 
the element's correspoding rank. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(Nlog(N)).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 72 ms, faster than 65.14% of Python3 online submissions for Relative Ranks.
Memory Usage: 15.1 MB, less than 88.81% of Python3 online submissions for Relative Ranks.
