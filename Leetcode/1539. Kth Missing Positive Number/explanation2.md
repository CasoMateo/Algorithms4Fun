**Algorithm Idea**

Generate a set from 1 to n + k. 
Get the difference between both sets, 
and return the kth element in such 
list after having it been sorted. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(Nlog(N)).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 44 ms, faster than 94.57% of Python3 online submissions for Kth Missing Positive Number.
Memory Usage: 14.7 MB, less than 9.42% of Python3 online submissions for Kth Missing Positive Number.
