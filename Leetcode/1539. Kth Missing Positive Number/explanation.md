**Algorithm Idea**

For every number that is missing in arr,
increase the count of missing numbers. Follow this 
process until such count gets to k. 

**Complexitis**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 200 ms, faster than 5.15% of Python3 online submissions for Kth Missing Positive Number.
Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 97.07% of Python3 online submissions for Kth Missing Positive Number.
