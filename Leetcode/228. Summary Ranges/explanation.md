**Algorithm Idea**

Get the initial array ranges by looking 
for missing elements. Then, iterate through 
the ranges and modify the array according to the
given format description. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 28 ms, faster than 81.49% of Python3 online submissions for Summary Ranges.
Memory Usage: 13.9 MB, less than 99.07% of Python3 online submissions for Summary Ranges.
