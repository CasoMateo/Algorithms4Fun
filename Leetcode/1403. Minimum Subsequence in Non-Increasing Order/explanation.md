**Algorithm idea**

Sort the array in decreasing order and return the first substring that 
satisfies the problem constraints. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 64 ms, faster than 86.80% of Python3 online submissions for Minimum Subsequence in Non-Increasing Order.
Memory Usage: 13.9 MB, less than 85.17% of Python3 online submissions for Minimum Subsequence in Non-Increasing Order.
