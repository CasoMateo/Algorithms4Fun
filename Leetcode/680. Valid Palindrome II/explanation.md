**Algorithm Idea**

For any two elements in the array that aren't 
equal, check if the string would be a palindrome 
if they were removed. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(NÂ²).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 72 ms, faster than 93.58% of Python3 online submissions for Valid Palindrome II.
Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 98.90% of Python3 online submissions for Valid Palindrome II.
