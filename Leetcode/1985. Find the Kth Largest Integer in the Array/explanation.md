**Algorithm Idea**

Parse the entire string array into an integer array. 
Then, sort such array and return the element at -k 
index. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(Nlog(N)).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 260 ms, faster than 100.00% of Python3 online submissions for Find the Kth Largest Integer in the Array.
Memory Usage: 21.9 MB, less than 100.00% of Python3 online submissions for Find the Kth Largest Integer in the Array.
