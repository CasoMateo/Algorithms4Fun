**Algorithm Idea**

Find the starting and ending index of 
each element, as well as its frequency. 
Then, update the resulting variable if its frequency 
is less than that of the current one. If they are equal, 
choose the one with the least difference between starting 
and ending indexes. 

**Complexities**
