**Algorithm Idea**

Use the sliding window tecnique 
to increase a current count of 
consecutive characters and reset 
it once the problems constraints 
are broken. Maintain a variable that 
will compare the retrieved values 
after each consecutive sequence.

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 32 ms, faster than 97.94% of Python3 online submissions for Consecutive Characters.
Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 72.67% of Python3 online submissions for Consecutive Characters.
