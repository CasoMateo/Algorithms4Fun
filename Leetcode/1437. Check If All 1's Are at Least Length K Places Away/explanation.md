**Algorithm Idea**

Account for the last seen index where 1 
is present, and compute its respective difference 
with the current index. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 548 ms, faster than 89.11% of Python3 online submissions for Check If All 1's Are at Least Length K Places Away.
Memory Usage: 16.8 MB, less than 85.47% of Python3 online submissions for Check If All 1's Are at Least Length K Places Away.
