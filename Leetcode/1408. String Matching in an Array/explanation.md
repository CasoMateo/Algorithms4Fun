**Algorithm Idea**

For each word in words, check if such string 
occurs as a substring of any other one 
in the array. If so, add such word to the 
answer. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N) - output array.

**Results**

Runtime: 32 ms, faster than 93.86% of Python3 online submissions for String Matching in an Array.
Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 83.00% of Python3 online submissions for String Matching in an Array.
