**Algorithm Idea**

Use two for loops to check for any occurrences of the 
current word as a substring in the array. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(NÂ²).
Space: O(N) - output array. 

**Results**

Runtime: 32 ms, faster than 93.86% of Python3 online submissions for String Matching in an Array.
Memory Usage: 14.1 MB, less than 83.00% of Python3 online submissions for String Matching in an Array.
