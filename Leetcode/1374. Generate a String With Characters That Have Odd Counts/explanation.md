**Algorithm Idea**

If n is odd, then use a character n number of times. 
Otherwise, use one character n - 1 times and use another 
one just once. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(1).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 32 ms, faster than 57.36% of Python3 online submissions for Generate a String With Characters That Have Odd Counts.
Memory Usage: 14 MB, less than 96.04% of Python3 online submissions for Generate a String With Characters That Have Odd Counts.
