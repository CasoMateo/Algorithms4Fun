**Algorithm Idea**

Take advtange of the fact that elements 
smaller than the given one will take 
less time, and elements greater than it 
will take the same time. After traversing the 
given number, no further elements need to 
be accounted for.

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 32 ms, faster than 92.21% of Python3 online submissions for Time Needed to Buy Tickets.
Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 20.55% of Python3 online submissions for Time Needed to Buy Tickets.
