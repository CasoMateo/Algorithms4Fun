**Algorithm Idea**

Build a dictionary containing all of the valid coordinates. 
Look for the coordinate with the lowest index that satisfies 
the given conditions (Manhattan Distance).

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 704 ms, faster than 81.81% of Python3 online submissions for Find Nearest Point That Has the Same X or Y Coordinate.
Memory Usage: 19.2 MB, less than 90.24% of Python3 online submissions for Find Nearest Point That Has the Same X or Y Coordinate.
