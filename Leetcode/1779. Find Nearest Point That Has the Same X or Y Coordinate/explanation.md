**Algorithm Idea**

Build a dictionary containing all of the valid coordinates. 
Look for the coordinate with the lowest index that satisfies 
the given conditions (Manhattan Distance).

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 700 ms, faster than 88.90% of Python3 online submissions for Find Nearest Point That Has the Same X or Y Coordinate.
Memory Usage: 19.4 MB, less than 69.89% of Python3 online submissions for Find Nearest Point That Has the Same X or Y Coordinate.
