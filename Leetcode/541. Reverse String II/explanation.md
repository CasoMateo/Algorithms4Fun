**Algorithm Idea**

While not having reached the end of the array, 
reverse the first k elements of the current subarray.
This subarray is given by a range of 2 * k.

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 28 ms, faster than 91.60% of Python3 online submissions for Reverse String II.
Memory Usage: 14.6 MB, less than 18.57% of Python3 online submissions for Reverse String II.
