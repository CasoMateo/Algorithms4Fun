**Algorithm Idea**

Add the width of the current letter to the 
current accumulation of widths if the added 
sum does not 100. Otherwise, we have used a new
line, and update the current amount of widths to the 
one set be the actual letter. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 32 ms, faster than 72.51% of Python3 online submissions for Number of Lines To Write String.
Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 76.63% of Python3 online submissions for Number of Lines To Write String.
