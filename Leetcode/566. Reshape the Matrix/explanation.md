**Algorithm Idea**

If the given measures don't match the 
number of elements in the array, return 
the given list. Otherwise, turn all rows in the 
array into separate items in a list. Slice such 
list in r subarrays of length c.

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 80 ms, faster than 96.63% of Python3 online submissions for Reshape the Matrix.
Memory Usage: 15 MB, less than 36.61% of Python3 online submissions for Reshape the Matrix.
