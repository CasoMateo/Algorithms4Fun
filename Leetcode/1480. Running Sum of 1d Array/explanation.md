**Algorithm Idea**

Keep the current sum of the array, add the value of every 
item to this variable and append it to the output array.

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 16 ms, faster than 99.60% of Python online submissions for Running Sum of 1d Array.
Memory Usage: 13.4 MB, less than 98.53% of Python online submissions for Running Sum of 1d Array.
