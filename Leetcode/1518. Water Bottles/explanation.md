**Algorithm Idea**

Accumulate the number of reusable water bottles, and 
the remaining amount of empty bottles to be used later.
Update the drinkable amount of bottles correspondingly after each iteration. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 20 ms, faster than 98.96% of Python3 online submissions for Water Bottles.
Memory Usage: 14.1 MB, less than 71.09% of Python3 online submissions for Water Bottles.
