**Algorithm Idea**

Get the number of 1s you would get if you 
were to split the string for each index. 
Add the corresponding number to the number of 
seen 0s and update the largest variable accordingly. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 28 ms, faster than 95.94% of Python3 online submissions for Maximum Score After Splitting a String.
Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 49.38% of Python3 online submissions for Maximum Score After Splitting a String.
