**Algorithm Idea**

Adjust two pointers and adjust their 
positions according to their correpsonding array values. 
This way, the farther the lines, the more the area that 
will be computed.

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 764 ms, faster than 38.94% of Python3 online submissions for Container With Most Water.
Memory Usage: 27.6 MB, less than 49.56% of Python3 online submissions for Container With Most Water.
