**Algorithm Idea**

Check the corresponding previous and next values for every
element of the list. If both measurements equal 0, increase 
the number of available spaces and denote the current plot as 
occupied.

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 160 ms, faster than 87.12% of Python3 online submissions for Can Place Flowers.
Memory Usage: 14.5 MB, less than 65.71% of Python3 online submissions for Can Place Flowers.
