**Algorithm Idea**

Return the array multiplied by 2. 
In other words, the concatenation of the 
array according to the problem constraints 
is equal to the result of this operation. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 80 ms, faster than 95.56% of Python3 online submissions for Concatenation of Array.
Memory Usage: 14.5 MB, less than 83.32% of Python3 online submissions for Concatenation of Array.
