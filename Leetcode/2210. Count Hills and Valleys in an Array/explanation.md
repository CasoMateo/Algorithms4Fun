**Algorithm Idea**

Eliminate all duplicates from the array, and look for valleys and 
hills. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1). 

**Results**

Runtime: 56 ms, faster than 83.33% of Python3 online submissions for Count Hills and Valleys in an Array.
Memory Usage: 13.8 MB, less than 83.33% of Python3 online submissions for Count Hills and Valleys in an Array.
