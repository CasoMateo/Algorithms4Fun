**Algorithm Idea**

For each element in the array, check if it has been seen before and 
whether the same item can be found more than once in the array. Return 
the current index if these conditions are true. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(NÂ²) - one for loop and linear search for every iteration. 
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 72 ms, faster than 91.74% of Python3 online submissions.
Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 87.84% of Python3 online submissions.
