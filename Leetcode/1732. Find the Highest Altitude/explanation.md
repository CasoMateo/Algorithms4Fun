**Algorithm Idea**

Update each element by the sum of itself and 
the previous one. At the end, return either the maximum 
number in the array, or zero (depending on which one is 
greater). 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 32 ms, faster than 82.80% of Python3 online submissions for Find the Highest Altitude.
Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 68.79% of Python3 online submissions for Find the Highest Altitude.
