**Algorithm Idea**

Get all indices whose element matches c, 
and for every item seen, traverse such 
list to find the one it's closer to. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(NÂ²).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 124 ms, faster than 8.20% of Python3 online submissions for Shortest Distance to a Character.
Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 80.20% of Python3 online submissions for Shortest Distance to a Character.
