**Algorithm Idea**

Get all the different integers and filter them 
out according to their integer, not string, form.

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 52 ms, faster than 10.00% of Python3 online submissions for Number of Different Integers in a String.
Memory Usage: 14.1 MB, less than 94.39% of Python3 online submissions for Number of Different Integers in a String.
