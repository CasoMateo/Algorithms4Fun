**Algorithm Idea**

Iterate from 1 to n, and for each 
number, call a function dictating whether 
the current integer is self-dividing or not. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N * M) - where M is the number of digits in N. 
Space: O(N) - output array. 

**Results**

Runtime: 44 ms, faster than 82.25% of Python3 online submissions for Self Dividing Numbers.
Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 82.34% of Python3 online submissions for Self Dividing Numbers.
