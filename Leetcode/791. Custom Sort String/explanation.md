**Algorithm Idea**

Find the index and the number of times each
item has to be inserted. 
Sort the dictionary by value and traverse 
it correspondingly, making use of its 
respective key-value pairs.

**Complexities**

Time: O(Nlog(N)) - sorting. 
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 28 ms, faster than 85.88% of Python3 online submissions for Custom Sort String.
Memory Usage: 14 MB, less than 99.16% of Python3 online submissions for Custom Sort String.
