**Algorithm Idea**

Find the frequency of each item in s. 
Iterate over order such that the 
output string follows such pattern. 
At the end, add elements that do not need to 
be ordered in a particular manner. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 28 ms, faster than 85.86% of Python3 online submissions for Custom Sort String.
Memory Usage: 14 MB, less than 99.16% of Python3 online submissions for Custom Sort String.
