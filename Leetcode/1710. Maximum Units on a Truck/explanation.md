**Algorithm Idea**

Use a greedy approach to add the boxes with the most units 
per box while there are boxes remaining.

**Complexities**

Time: O(Nlog(N)).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 148 ms, faster than 92.81% of Python3 online submissions for Maximum Units on a Truck.
Memory Usage: 14.8 MB, less than 45.64% of Python3 online submissions for Maximum Units on a Truck.
