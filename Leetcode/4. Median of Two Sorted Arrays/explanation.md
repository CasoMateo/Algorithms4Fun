**Algorithm Idea**

Merge the arrays in increasing order. Find the median 
according to whether the length of the new array is 
even or not.

**Complexities**

Time: O(Nlog(N)).
Space: O(1) - reutilization of the input arrays.

**Results**

Runtime: 80 ms, faster than 98.13% of Python3 online submissions for Median of Two Sorted Arrays.
Memory Usage: 14.5 MB, less than 78.42% of Python3 online submissions for Median of Two Sorted Arrays.
