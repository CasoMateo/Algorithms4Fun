**Algorithm Idea**  

Get the distance between each coordinate in the 
r x c matrix and sort them in ascending order. Traverse 
the dictionary and add the corrects in the expected order.

**Complexities**

Time: O(r * c).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 152 ms, faster than 89.01% of Python3 online submissions for Matrix Cells in Distance Order.
Memory Usage: 15.8 MB, less than 89.28% of Python3 online submissions for Matrix Cells in Distance Order.
