**Algorithm Idea**

Concatenate all elements of both strings, and check if they 
are equal. Use lists because of Python's string immutability.

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 32 ms, faster than 69.14% of Python3 online submissions for Check If Two String Arrays are Equivalent.
Memory Usage: 14 MB, less than 99.54% of Python3 online submissions for Check If Two String Arrays are Equivalent.
