**Algorithm Idea**

For every character in the string, remove it from the 
beginnning and append it. Check if the new string 
is equal to goal each iteration.

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 20 ms, faster than 99.12% of Python3 online submissions for Rotate String.
Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 72.73% of Python3 online submissions for Rotate String.
