**Algorithm Idea**

Duplicate zeros once they have been 
found. Eliminate the k last elements  
of the array, where k is the frequency 
of the number 0 in the initial list.

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 72 ms, faster than 64.11% of Python3 online submissions for Duplicate Zeros.
Memory Usage: 14.7 MB, less than 85.68% of Python3 online submissions for Duplicate Zeros.
