**Algorithm Idea**

The minimum difference will lie between adjacent 
elements in a sorted array. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(Nlog(N)).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 72 ms, faster than 72.06% of Python3 online submissions for Minimum Time Difference.
Memory Usage: 16.8 MB, less than 96.18% of Python3 online submissions for Minimum Time Difference.
