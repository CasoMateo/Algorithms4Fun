**Algorithm Idea**

Find the index of each restaurant in list2. Then, 
traverse list1 and replace the current restaurant 
intersection if its  sum of respective indexes 
is greater than those of list1[i], if it is 
in both lists, that is. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 152 ms, faster than 77.52% of Python3 online submissions for Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists.
Memory Usage: 14.6 MB, less than 87.20% of Python3 online submissions for Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists.
