**Algorithm Idea**

Find the frequency of each element in arr1, 
and follow the pattern in arr2 with such 
dictionary. Extend this "new" array with 
the remaining elements (finding the difference 
between arr1 and arr2).

**Complexities**

Time: O(Nlog(N)).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 32 ms, faster than 92.45% of Python3 online submissions for Relative Sort Array.
Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 86.99% of Python3 online submissions for Relative Sort Array.
