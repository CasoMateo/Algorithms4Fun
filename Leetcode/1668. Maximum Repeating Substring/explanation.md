**Algorithm Idea**

While an increasing string of elements is still present in the 
sequence, increment a count variable. At the same time, add 
another occurrence of "word" to res, and for every iteration, 
check if res can be found in the string. 

**Complexities**

Time: O(N).
Space: O(1).

**Results**

Runtime: 28 ms, faster than 84.18% of Python3 online submissions.
Memory Usage: 14.1 MB, less than 91.58% of Python3 online submissions.
