**Algorithm Idea**

Get the string frequencies and sort them 
in decreasing orders.

**Complexities**

Time: O(Nlog(N)).
Space: O(N).

**Results**

Runtime: 52 ms, faster than 64.34% of Python3 online submissions for Sort Characters By Frequency.
Memory Usage: 17.3 MB, less than 15.14% of Python3 online submissions for Sort Characters By Frequency.
